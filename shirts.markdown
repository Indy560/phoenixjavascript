Let's have the members design the next shirt. If you're design wins, you'll get one and we'll give out the rest as prizes for meetings.

Go to [Custom Ink](http://www.customink.com/) to make your design. Then tweet a link to your design to [@phxjavascript](https://twitter.com/phxjavascript). Please submit your designs by February 11th.

Also, see our [brand page](/brand.html) for logos and colors
