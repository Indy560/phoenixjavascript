title: 2015 T-Shirt Contest
---

Let's have the members design the next shirt. If you're design wins, you'll get one and we'll give out the rest as prizes for meetings.

Go to [Custom Ink's Design Lab](http://www.customink.com/lab) to make your design. Then tweet a link to your design to [@phxjavascript](https://twitter.com/phxjavascript). Please submit your designs by February 11th.

Also, see our [brand page](/brand.html) for logos and colors. Our past designs are shown here to give you some ideas. The top backs of these shirts had the logo, not that this has to be the case.
