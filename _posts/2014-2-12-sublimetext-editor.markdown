Sublime Text Editor has become very popular in the last few years - partially due to it's huge amount of features, shortcuts, workflow integration, and extensions. For this meeting we will be inviting anyone (you don't have to tell me ahead of time) to show off your Sublime Text skills and teach everyone your favorite things.

It's free to download and try - without trial expiration. It works on Mac, Win, and Linux. Oh yea, and you configure it's settings with JSON - how cool is that!
