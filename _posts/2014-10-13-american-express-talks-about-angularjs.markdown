AngularJS has been described as “a new, powerful, client-side technology that provides a way of accomplishing really powerful things in a way that embraces and extends HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while shoring up some of its glaring deficiencies. It is what HTML would have been, had it been built for dynamic content.”

In this session, Smitha Sebastian will explain what AngularJS is and why you should use it. She also will describe AngularJS features, directives, controllers, services, modules and routing, and will demonstrate how to build a small app in AngularJS. Got AngularJS questions? Bring them and let’s solve them together.

Smitha Sebastian is a Senior Software Engineer at American Express. She has been doing web engineering for more than 12 years and has engineered applications that have millions of users and handle billions of dollars in transactions.
