JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It's used extensively in JavaScript powered webpages. MongoDB stores native JSON objects directly, thus making it an ideal platform for storing and providing data to web based applications.

I'll develop a simple (CRUD) REST application in Node JS using MongoDB . Iâ€™ll also preview using Mongo's JavaScript shell to create a database, collections, documents. To wrap it up I'll create a web based form to interface with the Rest service.
