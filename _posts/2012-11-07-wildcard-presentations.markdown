I want to try something a little different for this meeting. Bring in your code for a quick presentation and show it to the group (5-10 mins). Teach the group about an innovating method of solving JavaScript, HTML, and CSS common problems, present your custom plugin or algorithm, or show something your working on and get your questions answered. Presentations can (and probably will) range from beginner to advanced.

Please let me know ahead of time if you want to present something. Those who do will get first slots. Slots will be limited: brad@azpixels.com

For the workshop, I want to give a small presentation on how to better use CSS and HTML. I'll show how you only need to know about 10 CSS properties to do almost everything you need.
