jQuery is a tool that every web developer should have in their toolbox. Some find jQuery to be much easier to program in than native JavaScript alone. However with so many different ways to accomplish the same task, these multiple techniques can be intimidating for beginners. I remember it was for me when I first started.

This presentation will teach you how to avoid the common pitfalls and how to employ some of jQuery's best practices. You will leave this presentation with real world code in your hands and knowledge of how to use it. Hopefully by the end you won't feel that jQuery is a mysterious black box tool anymore.
