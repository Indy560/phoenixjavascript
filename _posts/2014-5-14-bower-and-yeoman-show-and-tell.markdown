In this meeting we're going to do a show-and-tell for Bower - the package manager for front-end web development. If you haven't seen Bower before, you're in for a fun ride! We can also talk about Yeoman and other similar tools that facilitate Bower or are alternatives to it.

Dhruv Patel from Omazing Creations, then Tim Sullivan from PayPal will kick the meeting off with an introduction to Bower including setup with Yeoman, installing specific front-end components and libraries, Importing/Testing components, and grunt-bower

Then the floor is open to all members who want to show off their favorite tips, tricks, and components. If you'd like to present something, try to make it short and sweet since we might have several presenters. Also you don't have to schedule anything with me to speak, but a mention of what you're going to talk about in the comments below would help me plan and also help prevent overlapping topics
