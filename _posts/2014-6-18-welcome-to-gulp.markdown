Gulp is a JavaScript build system similar in purpose to Grunt. Unlike Grunt, its core principles are configuration as code to make it easier to understand and debug, and using Node streams to avoid temp files and make it faster. We'll start with a look at streams, the technology behind Gulp, wander through a Gulp hello world, dig into the Gulp API in great depth, build a few Gulp projects, build a Gulp plugin, and discuss best practices. Got Gulp questions? Bring them and let's solve them together. Got a particularly cool gulpfile? Come demo it to us as we open the discussion up to show-n-tell.
