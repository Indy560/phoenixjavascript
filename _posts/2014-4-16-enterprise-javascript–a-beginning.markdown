State Farm is starting to look at JavaScript as an first-rate enterprise level language, and we’d like to share some of the experiences we’ve had with the community. We’ll be talking about many of the different JavaScript frameworks we’ve looked at – what we liked and what we didn’t. Additionally we’ll be looking at examples of how we’re doing some of the core enterprise code features with JavaScript (unit test, end to end test, CI, code coverage, build, etc.) The presentation will be very conversational as we’d love to discuss the decisions we’ve made, and are interested to hear the approaches others have taken.
