React bills itself as "A Javascript library for building user interfaces." It was created by Facebook and uses a "virtual DOM" for ultra-high performance. It also uses some internal magic to batch changes and keep your UI fast - their goal is making your application run at a full 60fps. React's API is also pretty small, making it very easy to start using. I'll talk about the how React works and where it fits into the front-end MV* stack, walk through some examples of React components and show you how to create your own. You'll leave with a solid understanding of how React works and the knowledge to start using it to build blazing fast interfaces in the browser.
