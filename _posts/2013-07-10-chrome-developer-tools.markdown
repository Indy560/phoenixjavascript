In this talk I'll assume you know the basics of inspecting HTML and CSS with the chrome developer tools. We'll dive into debugging JavaScript with focus on the various ways to set breakpoints and how to view stack traces. I'll also show how source maps are used to debug minified JavaScript on your production site. The talk will be based on the production version of Chrome. If time permits, we may venture into features seen in Chrome Canary so you can see what is on the horizon.
