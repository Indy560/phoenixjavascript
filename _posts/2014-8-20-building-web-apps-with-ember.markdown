Ember.js describes itself as "A framework for creating ambitious web applications". It embraces conventions that allow you to focus on your application specific logic rather than trivial architecture decisions or boilerplate code. Ember Data is a persistence framework that provides the functionality and flexibility that a data layer in complex apps require. Ember CLI is a set of command line tooling that allows you to quickly create, test and build your application. We'll see how we can use these technologies to rapidly build a web application that connects to an existing JSON api. As we build it out, we'll discuss different Ember concepts and see how they fit into the whole of Ember.
