This presentation will be an introduction to unobtrusive client side Javascript using jQuery library. We will be doing two jQuery meetings back-to-back where this one will be considered the "more beginner" version and the meeting in May will be built off of this one. If you are new to jQuery this will be a must-see presentation! If you are new to programming in general, you might want to brush up on some basic skills before this meeting as this presentation will expect you to at least know basic programming concepts. Show up early if you think you'll need extra help. As always we will have pizza at the meeting.
