Orion Health (one of our sponsors) is offering to host us in Scottsdale for February. We are very thankful for the offer. We will be in building C-100.

Meeting Description: 

Meteor JS is a relatively new full stack JavaScript solution (https://www.meteor.com/). It provides a full featured stack that is capable of binding data securely all the way from the web view to the data layer with a minimal amount of code, and its all reactive. Intrigued? Great! Not sure what half those words mean? Great! Come check out the presentation and leave with a sense of wonder.

I'll cover features of the Meteor framework, basic project setup, and use in an application. We'll wrap up with a presentation of the Wiblits (https://wiblits.com/) platform which is built on Meteor by its developer Colin Turner.
