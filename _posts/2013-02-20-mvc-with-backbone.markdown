Separation of concerns server-side has led to higher quality, easier to maintain, loosely coupled code. Patterns such as MVC facilitate separating the presentation from the calculation. Client-side is no different, and graduating from a big blob of spaghetti in a button click event handler will yield more maintainable, higher quality code. Let's explore the various components of Backbone, a light-weight, unopinionated JavaScript MVC-like library that provides great pub/sub eventing, declarative DOM event binding, one-way model binding, client REST mechanisms for data persistence, and in-page view navigation.
