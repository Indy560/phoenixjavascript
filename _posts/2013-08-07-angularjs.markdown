Jeff Cross, a core member of the AngularJS team at Google, will be discussing the philosophy of Angular, how to get started with building an app with Angular, and what's coming soon in the framework.

Also, a big thanks to Jeff and the Google team for providing Angular t-shirts (lots of them) which I will give out in person at the meeting
