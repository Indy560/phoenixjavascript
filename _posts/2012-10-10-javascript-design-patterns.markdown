Software Design Patterns are the building blocks on which professional applications are built. jQuery, Dojo, Node, Backbone etc... are all based on various well established patterns. Knowing the patterns will help you know the framework!

Also, I'd like to invite newer JS people to come at 6 for a workshop. If this works, we'll probably have such workshops regularly from 6 to 6:30 before the official meeting starts. Please email me if your are interested in attending brad@azpixels.com. If you are unfamiliar with the following terms or concepts, you should come (as they are essential for understanding the patterns talk)

OOP, JSON, Constructor, Namespace, Event Handlers
